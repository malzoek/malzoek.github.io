# Maltego Lambda How To
When building Maltego transforms one important piece of the equation is the transformation server.

One can get started building a transform server quickly by following the instructions here:
[Transform Host Server Setup]
(https://docs.paterva.com/en/developer-portal/tds-transforms/transform-host-server-setup/)

The following How To is designed to be an alternative to the method above so that one can eliminate the actual server by using Amazon’s Lambada, a service that runs code without the server.

The guide leverages heavily on the Zappa project.  
Zappa is designed to build and deploy Python WSGI scripts to AWS Lambda.

(https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa)

*WARNING*, I don’t claim to be an expert in any of these areas so if you see a piece that is wrong or could be improved please let me know.

Step 1:  You’ll need to sign up for an amazon account and install Boto3.
[Quickstart — Boto 3 Docs 1.4.7 documentation]
(http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html#installation)
``` py
pip install boto3
aws configure
```

When configuring your amazon AWS a credential file will be generated @ ~/.aws/config

``` text
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
```

Step 2:  You’ll need to install Zappa.  There is excellent documentation on their GitHub site
[GitHub - Miserlou/Zappa: Serverless Python Web Services]
(https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa#initial-deployments)
``` text 
pip install zappa
zappa init
```

During the init a series of questions will be asked.  Here is how I respond to those questions but your responses may vary.

The first step names the end-point API.  I create my first end-point something_dev in this case maltego_dev

The second step reads the AWS credential file that was created when installing AWS boto3

The second step prompts you to name your s3 bucket where you source code will be uploaded to AWS

Region availability

And your output will a Zappa setting file named zappa_settings.json

``` json
{
    "maltego_dev": {
        "app_function": "maltego_transforms.app",
        "aws_region": "us-east-2",
        "profile_name": "somethinghere",
        "s3_bucket": "maltego-serverless-transforms"
    }
}
```

Once the settings file is complete you can deploy the app to AWS and some magic happens
``` bash
zappa deploy maltego_dev
```

At this point you have a empty Flask application sitting on Lambda.  Go ahead and test out the end point as this will be what you use when setting up your transform.  You should see a debug message but that will be taken care of when we start building our transforms.

Step 3:  Building Flask Based Transforms
The following is flask based with two functions.  

The root / directory will return a simple line of text that can be used to validate your Flask app is working and serving content.

The next /stuff2stuff is the transform
This endpoint will be used in the Paterva TDS
https://a3mwnt1kz9.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/maltego_dev/stuff2stuff

``` python
import requests
import json

from flask import Flask
from flask import request

from Maltego import *

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
	return "Maltego Transformations Ready Without a Server To Crash"

@app.route('/stuff2stuff', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def stuff():
	#This line takes the entity that is passed on creates a Maltego MSG object so you can access the values
	maltego = MaltegoMsg(request.get_data()) 
	TRX = MaltegoTransform()
	TRX.addEntity("maltego.Phrase", maltego.Value)
	return TRX.returnOutput()

if __name__ == '__main__':
	app.run()
```

Step 4:  Configure TDS to point to end-point

Adding the following to the Paterva TDS Server.  You may need to refresh your Maltego Client to pull in the new transforms
